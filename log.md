# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 15, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started work on bindings for the ncurses library and made sure that it can print correctly

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Bindings to the libary](roguelike/src/utils/graphics.rs)
2. [Initial main code to test](roguelike/src/main.rs)
